**1. What did you build?**
I built a slot machine around the theme of Fortnite.

**2. What language(s) or tools did you use?**
I used HTML for the entire file, and then I had script and style tags in the code for the JavaScript and CSS.

**3. Which AI tools did you use, and how?**
Initially, I used Claude, but I ran out of prompts so I switch to Blackbox AI. I asked the AIs to generate most of the code. Then I put the code into VS Code and ran it. Next, I debuggaed the code and added my own touch to the website.

**4. What did you do versus what AI helped with?**
I troubleshooted the code most of the time fixing tiny mistakes in the code such as the progress bar not resetting or the balance not updating. AI just helped with the base code of the website, and if I was confused about something, then I would ask the AI for help.

**5. What’s one thing you’re proud of?**
I'm proud of myself for finally being able to make it where the button disables when the slot machine is spinning, and fixing all those errors mostly by myself.

**6. What’s one thing you’d improve with more time?**
I'd add my own icons for the slot machine, make the prizes better, and add some music in the background.
