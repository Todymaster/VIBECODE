- **Description:** A web-based slot machine game themed around Fortnite, allowing users to spin reels, place bets, and earn V-Bucks.

## Prerequisites
- **Web Browser:** Ensure you have a modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.) to run the HTML files.
- **Audio File:** Ensure the audio file `coralcorus.mp3` is available in the same directory as the HTML files for background music.

## Environment Setup
- **Local Environment:**
  - No special software is required; simply a web browser to view the HTML files.

## Deployment Steps
1. **Download the HTML Files**
   - Save the provided HTML code into two files:
     - `cover.html` (for the cover page)
     - `game.html` (for the actual game)

2. **Add Audio File**
   - Place the audio file `coralcorus.mp3` in the same directory as `cover.html` and `game.html`.

3. **Open the Cover Page**
   - Open your web browser.
   - Drag and drop the `cover.html` file into the browser or use `File > Open` to navigate to the file.

4. **Navigate to the Game**
   - From the cover page, there should be a link or button to navigate to `game.html`. Click it to start the game.

5. **Interact with the Game**
   - Adjust the bet amount using the "+" and "-" buttons.
   - Click the "SPIN" button to spin the reels.
